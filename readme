# DungeonShell üêâ

DungeonShell is our submission for the AI Hackathon.  
It‚Äôs a text-based adventure game inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*, where an AI Dungeon Master guides the players through dynamic, story-rich encounters.  

The Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the **Dungeon Master**, responsible for:
- Crafting immersive scenes and settings across any theme or genre.  
- Creating enemies, NPCs, and plot twists on the fly.  
- Mutating the game state based on rules, ensuring continuity and progression.  

Meanwhile, the **core mechanics and game rules** are strictly enforced to prevent randomness or ‚Äúrule-breaking.‚Äù  
This combination results in battles and adventures that are both consistent and highly engaging, while still allowing the AI freedom to tell a fun, unpredictable story.

## Features
- AI-driven **Dungeon Master** that narrates, describes, and adapts to player actions.  
- Fixed **rule-based game mechanics** (combat, turns, abilities, etc.) to keep the game fair and structured.  
- Thematic flexibility ‚Äî the story can shift into fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or anything else.  
- Engaging, replayable gameplay with both **mechanical depth** and **narrative creativity**.
